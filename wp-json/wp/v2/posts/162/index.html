Flounder<\/h3>\n<p>Flounder has had a lot of progress on our Vulkan implementation over the past 2 months, we are at a point where real game development is around the corner. We are using Vulkan for flexibility, reliability, speed, and future-proofing, we currently do not plan on adding support for other graphics pipeline such as Direct3D or OpenGL. <em><\/em>This week we finished a simple Deferred Rendering system and added a very basic entity component system. The demo has been getting better terrain, and water reflections. We will be adding a physics system, animations, asset management, and particles over the next few months to finish off a version of Flounder that is conformable enough to develop a game off of.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Ludum Dare<\/h3>\n<p>We will probably be participating in the next LD Jam (starting December 1st) and using Flounder to develop a 3D game.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4.
